HISTORY
	v1.3.1 - XMP marker support and new --csv option (by Matteo Croce),
		 use DESTDIR instead of INSTALL_ROOT (by Samuli Suominen),
		 changes to make compiling under Win32 and Win64
		 easier (thanks to Javier Guti√©rrez),
                 preserve permissions of files being optimized,
                 skip symlinks (and other special files),
                 other minor fixes
        v1.3.0 - support for progressive jpegs added (fixes long standing
                 "bug" of progressive jpegs becoming non-progressive during
                 optimization), 
                 new options --all-normal & --all-progressive for
                 converting jpegs to non-progressive & progressive,
                 new -S / --size option to set target size for output
                 file (enables lossy optimization),
		 updated GPL/Copyrights language (thanks to Nicolas Vieville)

		 patch to make "quiet mode" (-q) be quiet by Mathieu Malaterre

		 ICC profile support by Dwight Kelly,
		 minor fixes

	         added for controlling what markers to strip.
